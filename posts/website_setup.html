    <h1 id="website-setup">Website Setup</h1>
<p>This post documents how my website is setup. Since I deploy it via github pages, that really ammounts to how it is built.</p>
<p>The premise is that I have several component projects that all dump their build artifacts into a common root directory. I then run the a templater on that directory to produce the final website.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>You will need the following special tools in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<h3 id="cobalt">Cobalt</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs">cobalt.rs</a> is a static site generator. I am currently using:</p>
<pre><code>Cobalt 0.7.2</code></pre>
<p>The best way to install cobalt is probably:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install cobalt-bin</code></pre>
<h3 id="pandoc">pandoc</h3>
<p><a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a> is best described on their homepage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The version of pandoc I am using is:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc 1.19.2.1
Compiled with pandoc-types 1.17.0.5, texmath 0.9, skylighting 0.1.1.4</code></pre>
<p>I installed pandoc using brew:</p>
<pre><code>brew install pandoc</code></pre>
<h3 id="blockpass">blockpass</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ThermalSpan/blockpass">blockpass</a> is a small utility I wrote. Top of tree should be fine for now. You can install by downloading and building it:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ThermalSpan/blockpass.git
cd blockpass
cargo install</code></pre>
<h2 id="dependences">Dependences</h2>
<p>These are are the projects that contribute content to the website.</p>
<h3 id="katex">KaTeX</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX">blockpass</a> is a javascript library for math rendering. From Khan Academy! I am currently using the following tag:</p>
<pre><code>v0.7.1</code></pre>
<p>Pandoc supports KaTeX in html, so that's how I use it.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc-posts">pandoc-posts</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ThermalSpan/pandoc-posts">pandoc-posts</a> is the repository where most of the posts live. Top of tree on the master branch should be sufficient. Drafts live in other branches.</p>
<h3 id="thermalspan.github.io-source">thermalspan.github.io-source</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ThermalSpan/thermalspan.github.io-source">thermalspan.github.io-source</a> is kitchen sink for this website. All the templates, misc pages, and such live here. And for now the &quot;build system&quot; does too, but I'd like to rip that out.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The pandoc posts project is really important, and is where most of the content lives. I would like to keep it as a seperate repisotory since it represents a good content divide. It also allows the issue tracker to be used soley for content related issues. I can also the branches to cleany mark drafts and such.</p>
<p>My short term goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have three articles that aren't totally embarrassing in the pandoc-posts project</li>
<li>Write a better build script / or find an off the shelf solution that meets my needs.</li>
<li>Fixup the connect page</li>
</ul>
<p>My medium term goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template the posts to include download link to pdf version</li>
<li>Include some projects</li>
<li>Perhaps host some documentation, though this is pending having a project that's worth documenting</li>
<li>To go with above, allow build script to build and include documentation in a clean way</li>
</ul>
<p>My long term goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seperate build system / templater from the webpage source</li>
<li>Include fancier front page options for sorting through options</li>
<li>Include a source option</li>
<li>Include at least one webGL / javascript interactive project</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nifty ideas that might be worth implementing:</p>
<ul>
<li>That progress bar that quantamagazine has on their articles is awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Post ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about cargo cache commands and how you use them</li>
<li>Talk about nvim setup, or at least one useful trick for configuring SpaceVim</li>
<li>Create Context Free Grammer cheatsheet</li>
<li>Walk through a cool math problem to show off all that awesome KaTeX</li>
<li>Introduce some notation and explain its tradeoffs. Like bra-ket, or Einstein summation.</li>
<li>Take some notes on the many papers you think you've read, maybe a prolog implementation paper</li>
<li>To maintain a list of other notable places on the web. Like other personal websites and such. Though, this might be better as a pure website for interactive purposes</li>
</ul>
